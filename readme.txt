Karoryfer x bigcat cello is a sample library for Plogue Sforzando version 1.845 or newer and Kontakt version 5.5.1 or newer (only works as a time-limited demo in the free Kontakt player). It contains samples of a cello performed by Kamila Borowiak.

This instrument is open source, and you can do whatever you want with it. However, the XML bank contains a digital signature, and editing the XML bank will break the ability of Plogue Sforzando to load the instrument with the GUI. If the NKI files are modified they will need to be saved from Kontakt (not Kontakt Player) in order to be usable.

To register the Sforzando bank, drag the Karoryfer x bigcat cello.bank.xml file onto the Sforzando interface. Once registered, the instrument will be available in the Sforzando loading menu and the GUI will work.

The Sforzando bank contains three instruments: bowed (velocity layer), bowed (mod wheel) and plucked. The bowed instruments include sustained and staccato articulations, as well as a scripted marcato which uses staccato attacks layered on top of sustained notes. The mod wheel version uses mod wheel to control volume and brightness, but staccato note volume and marcato attack volume are controlled by velocity. The velocity layer version and the plucked instrument use velocity only. Both bowed and plucked instruments include 4-voice and 8-voice unison mappings as well. The detune and width controls only affect the sound with the 4-voice and 8-voice mappings. The glide control affects glide time when one of the monophonic mappings is selected - it has no effect on the poly mappings.

The Kontakt version contains three instruments: sustain, staccato and pizz. They use the WIPS scripts for legato, vibrato etc. The WIPS scripts were designed with wind instruments in mind, but both the legato and vibrato work well for strings, though we generally recommend keeping the tremolo knob in the vibrato tab at low settings.

This sample library is royalty-free for all commercial and non-commercial use. The samples and sfz files are also open-source, and we especially encourage adaptation, reuse and further improvement of the vibrato, legato and humanization. The Kontakt instrument uses Robert D. Villwock's WIPS scripts - please see his site regarding information on reuse and modification of those scripts.
